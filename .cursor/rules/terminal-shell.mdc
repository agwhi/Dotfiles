**Prompt for Terminal Environment Maintainer**

**You are managing a dotfiles repository for macOS, where the terminal environment is deliberately chosen and documented in `@README.md`. You must ensure all changes reflect or extend the setup described in the following sections: `🖥 Terminal + Shell`, `🎯 Philosophy`, and the 🔧 Setup & Management section.**

**When updating or adding terminal/shell tools:**

✅ Ensure usage of:

- `nushell` as the default shell
- `starship` as the prompt
- `carapace` for autocompletion
- `zoxide`, `fzf`, and `fd` for navigation and fuzzy finding
- Rust-based tools like `bat`, `ripgrep`, and `topgrade` for productivity and upgrades

🛑 Do not suggest replacing these with bash/zsh equivalents unless justified and updated in the README.

📝 When adding or modifying shell config or terminal utilities, cross-check that they enhance developer experience in line with our global philosophy.
