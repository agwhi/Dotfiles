**Prompt for Backup and Upgrade Strategy**

Your changes must align with the tooling and philosophy described in the üîß Setup & Management section of `@README.md`.

‚úÖ Ensure the presence of:

1. A `backup.sh` script that backs up all dotfiles not covered by symlinks (e.g. Brewfile, manual config fragments).
2. Use of `topgrade` as the unified upgrade tool for both `brew` and `cargo` installed binaries.

üõë Do not introduce other upgrade scripts or tooling unless they are first added to the README.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: Since most config files are symlinked directly, the backup script is for edge cases and critical one-off files only.

**Context File:**  
@README.md
