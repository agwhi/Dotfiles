**Prompt for DevSecOps Security Configuration**

**This repository enforces global security standards via tools outlined in `@README.md`, specifically in the `ðŸ”’ DevSecOps` and `ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy` sections.**

**When working in this repo:**

1. Tools like `ripsecrets`, `gitleaks`, and `dotenv-linter` are part of the global security posture â€” changes to security tools must align with the current tooling stack in `@README.md`.
2. Git hooks must avoid interfering with local repo-specific hooks (e.g., Husky) and operate only at the global level, scanning for secrets and config drift.
3. If introducing a new global security tool, it must:
   - Operate at a system or global Git level
   - Not override or disrupt local `.git/hooks/`
   - Be added to the `ðŸ”’ DevSecOps` section in the README
4. Do not include CI-focused or repo-specific enforcement tools unless they provide system-wide consistency checks.
