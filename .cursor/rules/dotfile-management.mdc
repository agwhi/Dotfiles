**Prompt for Dotfile Manager**

**This repository uses a symlink-based approach for managing configuration files, backed by a backup script and optional secure overrides. Follow the guidance in the ðŸ”§ Setup & Management section of `@README.md`.**

**When modifying this repo:**

1. All editable tool configurations (e.g. `.gitconfig`, `env.nu`, VSCode settings, etc.) must be symlinked from the dotfiles directory to their active locations.
2. Symlink paths must be consistent and tracked; the `backup.sh` script should remain available for non-symlinked or edge-case file recovery.
3. Secrets or sensitive config (e.g. `.gitconfig.local`) should:
   - Be added to `.gitignore`
   - Have an `.example` version committed
   - Be documented in the appropriate security section
4. Do not copy/paste or hardcode dotfile paths â€” updates should always be reflected through symlinks or documented script logic. 5. If a new dotfile is added, update the relevant dotfile setup section in `@README.md`.
