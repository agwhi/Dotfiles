**Shell Environment:**

You are using `nushell` (not bash or zsh). Any shell commands, scripts, or examples should use `nushell` syntax and idioms, not POSIX-style shell.

If unsure how to express something in `nushell`, prefer clarity and simplicity. Favor the tools listed in the `README.md` file, especially for file manipulation, scripting, and task automation.

Your environment includes:

- `nushell` with `env.nu` and `config.nu`
- `starship`, `zoxide`, `fd`, `fzf`, `bat`, `ripgrep`, `just`, `carapace`, and other Rust-based tools
- Node with `pnpm` (via `corepack`)
- .NET 8
- AWS CLI + CDK
- `topgrade` for updates
- `direnv` and `.envrc` for secrets/config

Avoid suggesting `bash`, `sh`, or `zsh`. Prefer idiomatic `nushell`.

Reference: See `nushell/` directory and `README.md` for environment details.
