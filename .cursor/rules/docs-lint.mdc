**Prompt for Documentation Quality**

Ensure documentation in markdown files is clear, consistent, and aligned with best practices defined implicitly in `@README.md`.

âœ… Make sure:

- Tool explanations match those in the `README.md`
- Lists are well formatted and follow consistent heading structure
- Setup steps and usage notes are copy-paste friendly
- Documentation follows the same structure and tone as the main README

ðŸ›‘ Avoid outdated instructions, mismatched sections, or tools not listed in the README.

ðŸ“Œ Use markdown linting tools if available and follow general structure/patterns shown in `README.md`.

**Context File:**
