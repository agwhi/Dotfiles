**Prompt for Editor Configuration Maintainer**

**This dotfiles repository supports a multi-editor setup using VS Code, Neovim, and Cursor, with configurations managed through symlinks and documented in `@README.md`. Follow the guidance in `‚ú® Editor / IDE` and the üîß Setup & Management section.**

**When editing this repo:**

1. Do not introduce a new editor or editor-specific config without updating the appropriate section in the README.
2. Any changes to `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, `init.lua`, or `.cursor/rules` must reflect or extend what is already documented.
3. Dotfiles for all editors should be symlinked into place as described in the üîß Setup & Management section.
4. Ensure installed extensions and plugins are listed or referenced in the appropriate section of `@README.md`.
5. Do not introduce configuration that conflicts between VS Code, Neovim, and Cursor without justification in the README.

**For VS Code specifically:**

‚úÖ Ensure that:

- Workspace-wide VSCode settings are aligned with dotfiles (e.g., Biome integration, formatting settings)
- Extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json` match those required by tools in the README

üõë Avoid adding project-specific extensions unless they are clearly needed and documented in the repo README.

üìù If modifying `.vscode/settings.json`, explain how your changes improve developer experience globally.
