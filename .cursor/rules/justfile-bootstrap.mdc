**Prompt for Justfile Bootstrap Consistency**

All environment bootstrapping and developer onboarding tasks must be defined in the `justfile`, as described in the `ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy` section of `@README.md`.

âœ… Add or update tasks in the `justfile` for:

- Installing packages via `brew`, `cargo`, or `pnpm`
- Creating symlinks to dotfiles
- Backing up system state (e.g., `.gitconfig.local`)
- Running `topgrade` for upgrades

ðŸ›‘ Avoid using shell scripts or manual commands for these tasks unless there's a clear reason documented in the README.

ðŸ“Œ The `justfile` should be the canonical source of truth for project-wide and machine setup workflows.
