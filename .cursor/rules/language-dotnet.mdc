**Prompt for .NET 8 Serverless Developer**

**This repository defines a consistent global .NET 8 environment for use with AWS Lambda and CDK (in TypeScript) with application logic written in C#. Refer to `@README.md` sections `üåê AWS / Cloud Dev` and `üéØ Philosophy`.**

**When working in this repo:**

1. All global .NET-related tooling and configuration must align with the versions, tools, and structure defined in the README.
2. Only install global .NET tools that support AWS serverless workflows (e.g., `Amazon.Lambda.Tools`).
3. Do not include tools or settings that belong in per-repo configurations, such as project-specific NuGet sources or build scripts.
4. Keep all language-level setup consistent with the symlink and dotfile structure in the README.
5. If introducing a new tool or global behavior, it must be reflected in the relevant README section first.
